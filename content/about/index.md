My name is Raul Morales Delgado. I am a Data Scientist — with a background in Mechanical Engineering — based in Toronto, Canada. I have 4+ years of experience in Data Analytics and almost two years in Data Science.

While I am very passionate about AI — ML and deep learning — and Analytics — EDA and data visualization — I am also very fond of developing products end-to-end, hence my interest in MLOps, DevOps and Data Engineering in general. I believe that transforming a model from a Jupyter Notebook to an end-to-end stable and scalable solution has way more chances of being successfully deployed than one that does not.

This website is about work **projects**, some **tutorials** that started as personal notes, small articles — **nuggets** — about very punctual things, and a bit of **random** ideas (probably about typography, (another) passion of mine :ghost:)

My name is Raul Morales Delgado. I am a Data Scientist — with a background in Mechanical Engineering — based in Toronto, Canada. I have 4+ years of experience in Data Analytics and almost two years in Data Science.

As a Data Scientist, while I am very passionate about AI — ML, deep learning, predictive modeling — and Analytics — EDA and data visualization —, I am also a firm believer that transforming a model from a Jupyter Notebook into a stable and scalable solution makes it more likely to be successfully deployed into production, hence my interest in MLOps, Data Engineering and DevOps in general.

This website is a blog about my work in the previously described fields — here you will find [**projects**](/categories/projects), [**tutorials**](/categories/tutorials) that started as notes, small articles — [**nuggets**](/categories/nuggets) — about more specific things, and a bit of [**random**](/categories/random) posts about things I like (like $\text{typography}$ :ghost:).

Please feel free to contact me or see my work through any of the following at the footer.
